# temp-blanket-helper
Make your temperature blankets without tracking weather or doing math! 
This app uses a specific color scale and the previous week's average temperature.

## Disclaimer

This app only uses 1 color scale and if you want to alter it, you'll have to change the code. 
I made this app for my wife because she plans on making a temperature blanket in 2023. 
Below is the color scale she plans to use for each week's average temperature that I referenced when making this app.

## Color Scale
